# How To Run
To run the website, do the following:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python main.py` (NOTE: This takes about 30 seconds to initialize)
- Go to `localhost:5050` in your web-browser

- Plotly Dash
- Huggingface's implementation of Transformers (BERT and GPT2): https://huggingface.co/transformers/
